Chief Complaint: Agitation, altered mental status History of Present Illness: The patient was unable to participate in interview with me. This note is based heavily on the information gathered by the ED physicians and the Neurologist who consulted in the ED.  Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**] is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse with recent admission for presumed Wernicke encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal who presented from his skilled nursing/rehab center for agitation after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] two days ago. At the rehab facility, the patient spent the last 24 hours in severe agitation that required 4-point restraints and multiple chemical restraints in order for him to calm down.  According to the Neurologist in the ED, he was disoriented, tachycardic, agitated, and diaphoretic in the setting of presumed 3 days abstinence from benzos. Mr. [**Known lastname 62523**] had some restriction in eye movements but no gaze deviation and no lateralizing signs at this point. Neurology believes withdrawal is the most likely etiology. If fevers develop, he may require a lumbar puncture. such as infection  Metabolic derangements, drug overdose, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding can also mimic or coexist with withdrawal. In the absence of complications, symptoms can persist for up to seven days. Additionally as he does not seem to have full abduction of his eyes, Neurology recommends continuing on IV thiamine for presumed Wernicke's. Given that the mammillary bodies are enriched with dopamine receptors, would avoid Haldol as this may exacerbate his Wernicke Korsakoff's pathology.  
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old male with known ST elevation, MI, status post elective cath complicated by hypotension and bradycardia who was transferred to CCU for observation.  The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center on [**2163-1-14**] with chest pain radiating to the jaw.

The patient was noticed to have groin hematoma and angiocele was attempted.  He was also given 40 mg of Protamine in order to stop the bleeding.  At this time he became hypotensive.  This was thought to be secondary to vagal reflux.  He was given IV fluids and Dopamine after which he developed upper body pruritic rash.  Because of the concern for anaphylaxis secondary to dye Protamine, the patient was given 120 mg of Solu-Medrol and Benadryl as well as Promethazine and Pepcid.

Chief Complaint: hypoxia and confusion History of Present Illness: 77 y/o M with h/o CHF (EF= 40-45% on ECHO [**4-/2104**]), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from [**Hospital6 5016**] in [**Location (un) 7661**], MA for further management of hypoxia due to left upper lobe pneumonia and and ongoing delirium due to previous aspiration pneumonia (right middle lobe). The patient's current history starts [**2104-7-15**], when he was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] (requiring a brief ICU stay) for left upper lobe pneumonia, treated with levofloxacin X7 day course. He was discharged home with [**Hospital1 269**], but around [**7-25**] he started having hypoxia (resting O2sat of 95%, ambulatory O2sat of 85%), and also had cloudy urine. He was treated with Ciprofloxacin X2-3 days for UTI, but because his hypoxia persisted and he had progressively worse dyspnea, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-27**]. A new right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on CXR during that admission, which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia. Patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who felt he had silent aspirations. He was treated with an 8 day course of broad antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) which ended on [**2104-8-4**]. He was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on the 20th, but on the 21st he was sent to the [**Hospital6 5016**] because his O2 sats were down in the 80s. At the OSH, a CT chest was performed that showed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changes and a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe.

Chief Complaint: Biliary obstuction. History of Present Illness: This is an 88 yo man transferred from OSH [**11-4**] for ERCP for biliary obstruction with obstructive hepatopathy. presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath, dizziness, and jaundice. Per OSH also reported fevers, chills, and nausea. Had gveen given bactrim for a UTI one week prior. He underwent an abdomen CT which showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic obstruction likely secondary to metastatic cancer to the pancreatic head. He was started on flagyl, zosyn, and vanc and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.  While being prepped for ERCP (while under MAC) and turned prone he regurgitated coffee-brown material so he was electively intubated due to concern for his risk of aspiration. They proceded with ERCP, but were unable to cannulate the biliary tree. A dudodenal stent was placed due to external compression of the duodenum. He was placed on propofol for sedation and his SBP's dropped to the 80's in the PACU. He was started on neo through a PIV for pressure support.  In the ICU the neo was rapidly weaned and he was extubated easily [**11-5**]. It was thought that his inability to extubate post-procedure and hypotension were due to sedation rather than aspiration given his rapid improvement.

Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] presented for scheduled laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies due to bilateral ovarian cysts with solid components. History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 111230**] is a 53-year-old G4, P4-0-0-4 perimenopausal Caucasian female with bigeminy arrhythmia, depression, GERD, and is S/P C/S x4 plus LTL. Ms. [**First Name (Titles) 111231**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a pelvic ultrasound [**12/2179**] for complaints of abnormal bleeding.  It revealed a 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac cyst separate from the right ovary and a 3.5 cm simple left ovarian cyst.  The uterus measured 10.9 cm but was otherwise unremarkable with endometrial stripe of 8 mm.  She had a followup pelvic ultrasound ([**2180-2-2**]) that revealed resolution of the 7.7 cm posterior cul-de-sac cyst with a normal right adnexa.  She had two left ovarian cysts sizing 2-2.5 cm.  Endometrial stripe measured 1.1 cm with a questionable 6-mm endometrial polyp. . In regards to her endometrial lesion and abnormal bleeding, she [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] an office endometrial biopsy ([**2180-1-18**]).  It revealed scant inactive endometrium with no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.  A diagnostic office hysteroscopy ([**2180-4-19**]) revealed a normal endometrial cavity with no evidence of any endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids.  There were no active issues regarding the endometrial findings and the patient maintained expectant management.  In regards to her abnormal bleeding, given the benign endometrial biopsy and normal hematocrit, the patient opted to maintain expectant management. . In regards to her pelvic and left ovarian cysts, it appeared that the patient had remained asymptomatic and this was an incidental finding.  The large 7.7 cm right posterior cul-de-sac cyst had resolved spontaneously and the left adnexal cyst appeared to be oscillating in size and simple in nature. Therefore, the patient opted to maintain expectant management with intermittent surveillance given her asymptomatic state. . She recently had a pelvic ultrasound at [**Location (un) 620**] under Dr.[**Name (NI) 14510**] (PCP) instructions.  PUS ([**2182-11-12**]) at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] reveals a uterus measuring 11 x 4.2 x 6 cm.  Endometrial stripe measured 7 mm.  No endometrial polyp was appreciated.  The right ovary measured 3 cm in its greatest dimension with a large 8.9 x 4 cm cyst containing some debris.  There was additionally a smaller 1.3 cm nodule within it.  A third cystic area with flow was also noted along the edge of this large cystic lesion.  On the left, the left ovary measured 5 cm in its greatest dimension and contained a 2.2 cm simple cyst.  There was an additional 1.1-cm solid nodule & a small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. . She denied any symptoms related to these PUS findings such as pelvic pain.  On review of her menstrual pattern, she does report a pattern of oligomenorrhea consistent with perimenopause.  She did skip her menses in [**4-/2182**], [**5-/2182**], and [**6-/2182**] and has then resumed monthly menses in [**Month (only) 205**] with each episode lasting roughly five to eight days.  The amount of bleeding is lighter than her prior moderate to heavy flow noted two years ago. The patient continues to remain asymptomatic. Given the size of the lesions and the solid components, I advised surgical management even though she remains asymptomatic. After careful consideration, the patient would like to proceed with surgical evaluation.  A plan for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies with possible conversion to laparotomy was discussed.  Pelvic peritoneal washings will be obtained.  We also discussed the need for a staging procedure should surgical findings reveal a malignant condition.  The patient was consented for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, pelvic peritoneal washings, possible laparotomy, and possible staging procedure.  She understands that a staging procedure will be performed by one of our gynecologic-oncologist here at [**Hospital1 18**] if indicated (greatly appreciated).  The nature of the surgery, potential surgical risks, likely hospital and postoperative course were discussed with the patient in detail today.  Informed consent was obtained.

The details of the events leading up to his intubation are not clear.  In discussion with friend [**Name (NI) 73298**] [**Name (NI) **], she reports that [**Name (NI) 269**] came to visit on [**12-19**] at which time he was reportedly "doing well" in terms of his respiratory status.  Sometime after [**Month/Year (2) 269**] left, however, pt. called [**Doctor First Name 73298**] and told her he needed help as he could not breathe.  It was at that time that EMS was called. There is no EMS record in paperwork from the ED, but per verbal report from ED resident, pt was so SOB that he requested intubation when EMS arrived to his home.  Although per verbal s/o there was report that he never picked up steroids that were prescribed on discharge, I am unable to find a record of steroids having been prescribed during his last admission and further upon discharge.  He was intubated at home and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . Of note, he was admitted to the surgical service from [**Date range (1) 21504**]/08 after presenting with abdominal pain/rectal bleeding and progressive SOB.  He was intubated in emergency room d/t increasing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs. NGT tubes was placed with coffee grounds and he reportedly had episodes of maroon stool  EGD was performed on [**12-2**] which showed pyloric ulcers, but no e/o active bleeding.  He had subsequent additional hct drop and EGD was repeated on [**12-13**] showing e/o recently bleeding pyloric ulcer.  Ulcer was injected with epi and endoclip was deployed unsuccessfully.  He received a total of 8 units prbcs, 1 bag platelets, 1 unit FFP last on [**12-3**] after which his hct remained stable without any further bleeding.  He was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and was treated for h. pylori.  Although his respiratory failure was attributed to COPD exacerbation, it does not appear that he received steroids during his hospital stay.  He was, however, extubated successfully and when ambulating with PT during last admission, he became SOB with O2 sats dipping into the 80% and CTA was positive for subsegmental PE and he was started on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin prior to discharge. .

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 83 year old female status post atrial ablation, status post gastric ulcer perforation repair, status post pneumothorax after internal jugular placement, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, sepsis, Clostridium difficile. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a complicated patient who essentially was admitted to [**Hospital6 2018**] for EP ablation.  The patient had been admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-Gluver on [**2-10**] through [**2-24**].  The patient complained of left heart palpitations with weakness, dry cough, no nausea, fever, chills or vomiting.  The patient did have a little bit of yellow mucous when social history awoke on [**2-10**] with palpitations, notified her primary care physician who noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **] heartrate of 180 and sent her to the Emergency Room.  The patient did have a history of atrial tachycardia but it had been quiescent.  The patient had a long ventriculoperitoneal tachycardiac narrow complex at 139, a Dopamine drip was terminated but recurred.  Sotalol and Metoprolol was added.  Cardizem eventually was made p.o. Blood pressure had been limiting.  On [**2-12**] ? the patient had had surgery for repair of gastric ulcer perforation.  Records are not available at this time regarding that procedure.  The patient had near total gastric outlet obstruction, silk suture closed and placement of jejunostomy tube and gastrostomy tube.  Right internal jugular line was placed at the same time.  It was hard to control the patient's arrhythmias and was originally transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] service for EP ablation. However, the procedure was cancelled secondary to the patient developing a fever.  On transfer to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit the patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness and was evaluated in the Medicine Intensive Care Unit.

The patient had a second generalized convulsion upon entry to the [**Location (un) **] ER, he developed a massive tongue hematoma from a tongue bite, and underwent a difficult and prolonged intubation process.  INR was 3.2, which was in the appropriate range given the mechanical valve.  NCHCT revealed ICH and SAH.  He was loaded with 1 gram of dilantin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  At [**Hospital1 18**], CTA revealed left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to parietal sulci, 4-mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation pointing laterally, 2 to 2.5 mm aneurysm arising from the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of ventricular bodies.  In the ED, the patient received Factor 9 and 1 unit FFP. He subsequently received 6 units of platelets and FFP to reverse his coagulopathy. He was started on nimodipine and HOB was kept > 30 degrees.  A subsequent conventional angiogram further delineated the aneurysms; the Neurosurgery team felt that these aneurysms were unlikely to be the cause of the patient??????s bleeding.  Since there would be no further surgical intervention, the patient was transferred to the Neurology team in the ICU.

She was noted to be jaundiced, groggy, with a protuberant abdomen. WBC was 13.8, K 2.8, Bili 7.7, AST 324, ALT 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877. Tox screen and EtOH levels were negative. Her abdomen became distended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds. She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. She was treated with IVF and aggressive pain control with dilaudid 1mg IV q3. Additionally she was sedated on precedex and an ativan drip at 4mg/h. Pt was intubated for airway protection on the morning of [**10-14**]. CT of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas, extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severe pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainable fluid collections or evidence of perforation. Also noted were small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of free fluid in the deep pelvis. .  
 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of [**Location (un) 2174**] ataxia and cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolic dysfunction with negative catheterization, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3 weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea and vomiting.  The patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea with a 30-pound weight gain and decreased urine output.  She was noted to have an INR of 19.5 on admission.  She was given vitamin K and admitted to the Fennard Intensive Care Unit for concern for gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was also found to have nephrotic range proteinuria and elevated LFTs.  Echocardiogram revealed depression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.  GI Service was consulted and it suspected that her increasing liver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injury with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.  The Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic nephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.  She was initially started on Lasix for her uncompensated congestive heart failure, but her creatinine rose, so she was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to initiate nesiritide treatment.

He had blood and urine cultures that were also negative.  His fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir, though his mental status continued to fluctuate, and he was sent back to rehab on [**5-21**].  His sister continued to visit him, and reports that even as recently as two days ago he was actually starting to improve.  At his best he was reported to be communicative, with a slightly strange affect, and mild short term memory and executive function impairment.  However, on [**5-26**] he was noted to be very unsteady with PT, and was found to be orthostatic as low of SBP of 60 when standing, and it was recommended that he start both fludrocortisone and midodrine.  On [**5-27**] the patient was noted to be forcibly keeping his right eye closed, and also was felt to be more apraxic with worsening coordination.

Underwent emergent craniotomy for evacuation of bleed and tumor rescetion, she was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. She then developed hydrocephalus and had VP shunt placed on [**1-6**] and repeat VP shunt operation on [**1-14**] secondary to her failure at clamping trials. Prior to discharge she was noted to be febrile to 103 on [**11-13**] temp spiked to 101.5 with a productive cough, influenza was negative so she was discharged on levofloxacin, completed course [**1-21**]. Three sets of blood cultures and urine culture negative.  She also developed a diffuse morbiliform eruption rash after dilantin was started.  However, Dilantin was continued since the benefits of sizure prophylaxis outweighed risks of continuing medicaitons.  After discharge her fever resolved but the rash did not.  She used Sarna lotion and benadryl at home, but noted spread of the rash from truck outwards to extremities, sparing face palms and soles. .

She called her PCP who had her get a CXR that showed a right sided pleural effusion and pleural opacities that was followed-up with a CTA that failed to demonstrate PE but did show r. pleural effusion and non-pathologic nodules. An ECG showed no significant changes from baseline. Her D-dimer was >[**2193**], wbc 13->11, and LFT's were all within normal limits. The patient recieved toradol 15mg IV for pain with moderate effect.   Pt had CT that showed exudative right pleural effusion with negativ ecytology.  She was also scheduled for VATS given multiple pleural based nodules.  She also developed fever to 101.7, tachycardia, new wheezing and was thought to have pna with component of RAD/COPD.  Given this new wheeze, she was started on solumedrol and [**Name (NI) 110238**] (pt without history of RAD).  Pt developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, initially responded to nebs but then began to have decreased air movement despite receiving racemic epi.  Pt was then transferred to MICU for mgt/observation of airway.  Pt was seen by ENT in MICU who did not visualize any anatomic obstruction.  Pt put on facemask bipap on admission to MICU.

She was felt to be in congestive heart failure, was noted to have hyperkalemia, and apparently new renal failure with creatinine in 6's. A central line was placed but then the patient became agitated, self-extracted the femoral line. Serial haldol, benadryl and ativan x3 were not effective in sedating her and therefore the patient was intubated for airway protection. The femoral line was replaced. The patient had a NG tube placed, was given kayxelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and glucose for hyperkalemia, las well as lasix for CHF. She was given a dose of levoquin for UTI/possible pneumonia. The patient had an anion gap acidosis and there was concern for ethylene glycol because "urate crystals" were noted in the urine. .
