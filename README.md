## transformer/

First working implementation of a transformer, following http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers, applied to IMDB sentiment analysis. Achieved good accuracy (about 70% over 10 minutes training). Successfully setup local GPU usage, but memory was limited and had to limit the sequence length used.
